# Mad Runner

## Description

Mad Runner is an online video game in which you get to control a fast and agile car and you need the be the fastest on the circuit!

To succeed, be careful of water puddles: they make you drift! Also, obstacles are movable and there is "slipstream" behind other cars, so use the turbo and exploit it to the maximum level!
